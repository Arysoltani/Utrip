# Utrip
This C++ project employs object-oriented programming principles to create a hotel reservation system, progressing through three distinct phases. In Phase 1, the initial implementation is straightforward and lacks any user interface or statistical functionality. Phase 2 introduces statistical methods to enhance the project's capabilities. In the final Phase 3, a web interface is integrated into the system. 
This project served as the culmination of our Advanced Programming (AP) course, where we were required to apply all the knowledge and skills we had acquired up to that point.
